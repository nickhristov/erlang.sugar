This is a sugar for the Erlang language.

It includes code completion for *some* of the OTP libraries. It is work in progress and more libraries will be added.

I am also planning to add a hook to allow you to index your own projects.

To install, download the sugar and make sure that the folder which you expand (unzip/untar) ends in .sugar. Then place it in YOU_HOME_FOLTER/Library/Application Support/Espresso/Sugars/

TODO:
   - finish syntax: including better itemizer for functions
   - add support for code completion of function parameters.
   - write a script to create completion libraries based on open file (i.e a primitive form of project/file indexing). 
   - text actions:
       - erlang source code lint
       - compile
